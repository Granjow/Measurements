# Measurements

This repository holds electrical measurements.

AC power measurements have been taken with a RIGOL DS1054Z oscilloscope and a
differential probe from Testec, the TT-SI 9001.

**Warning: Never connect your oscilloscope to AC power with standard probes!**
Measuring AC power requires differential probes. For standard probes, the
reference voltage is connected internally to case ground and connecting it to
AC will essentially connect case ground to AC.

## Inrush Current

The measurements were measured over a 0.5 Î© shunt resistor.

### MeanWell RS power supplies

Designation of the power supplies: RS-`wattage`-`voltage`

RS-15-5, RS-15-12, RS-25-5, RS-25-48 all show the same inrush current of around
30 A, charging for 1 ms.
